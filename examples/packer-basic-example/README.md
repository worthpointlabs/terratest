# Packer Basic Example

This folder contains a very simple Packer template to demonstrate how you can use Terratest to write automated tests
for your Packer templates. The template just creates an up-to-date Ubuntu AMI by running `apt-get update` and
`apt-get upgrade`.

Check out [test/packer_basic_example_test.go](/test/packer_basic_example_test.go) to see how you can write
automated tests for this simple template.

Note that this template doesn't do anything useful; it's just here to demonstrate the simplest usage pattern for
Terratest. For slightly more complicated, real-world examples of Packer templates and the corresponding tests, see
[packer-docker-example](/examples/packer-docker-example) and
[terraform-packer-example](/examples/terraform-packer-example).
